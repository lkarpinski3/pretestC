Hi Ilean,

Thank you so much for your interest in this position I have in Santa Barbara, California.
Your resume has been reviewed and picked to move forward for the testing portion. Congratulations!
Before you receive more detailed information, here is a prep-test problem. I will call you once you have completed the test with further information regarding the organization and what to expect next.
Please complete the below programming problem and send back as soon as possible. Thank you so much!!
Please let me know if you have any questions.


Your mission is to write a program that accepts two strings as arguments and prints out all substrings that are common to each input string.
Instructions

* You may use C or C++.  Restrict your use of string related library functions to strcmp, strncmp, strcpy, strncpy, and strlen.  If you use C++ do not use STL.  Use standard language features; do not use C11 or C++ 2011 or beyond.  Do not use Microsoft extensions.

* Invoke your program as seen below. Please follow this interface, otherwise my testing script will fail.

```
% a.out string1 string2
```

* Print all common substrings occurring in each input string, one substring per line. Print a substring only once (no duplicates).  You may print substrings in any order.   A substring is a sequence of one or more consecutive characters.  Please don't print anything else.

* Your code should be case sensitive ("a" is distinct from "A")

* Your program must work correctly. I am not particularly concerned about memory usage or CPU time, though the program should run quickly enough to handle long input strings.  Treat this as throwaway prototype code -- don't worry too much about comments or style.

*       Please send your code and how much time this took (excluding time to set up your tools). Also, please attach an updated copy of your resume!
